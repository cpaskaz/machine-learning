An example could be a binary classification problem with a class distribution of 60% for one class and 40% for the other.\n","\n","**Moderate Imbalance**: Here, the imbalance starts to become more pronounced. For instance, in a binary classification problem, a distribution of 70% for one class and 30% for the other might be considered moderately imbalanced.\n","\n","**Severe Imbalance:** This is when the class distribution is highly skewed, making one class significantly underrepresented. An example would be having 90% of the data belonging to one class and only 10% to the other in a binary classification scenario.\n","\n","The specific threshold at which an imbalance becomes problematic varies, but generally, datasets where one class represents less than 20% of the total can start to introduce significant challenges for many standard machine learning models.
